  <Param type="RichFloat" description="Quality threshold" value="1" name="QualityThr" tooltip="Quality threshold for penalizing bad shaped faces.&lt;br>The value is in the range [0..1]&#xa; 0 accept any kind of face (no penalties),&#xa; 0.5  penalize faces with quality &lt; 0.5, proportionally to their shape&#xa;"/>

  <Param type="RichFloat" description="Boundary Preserving Weight" value="1" name="BoundaryWeight" tooltip="The importance of the boundary during simplification. Default (1.0) means that the boundary has the same importance of the rest. Values greater than 1.0 raise boundary importance and has the effect of removing less vertices on the border. Admitted range of values (0,+inf). "/>
  <Param type="RichBool" description="Preserve Normal" value="false" name="PreserveNormal" tooltip="Try to avoid face flipping effects and try to preserve the original orientation of the surface"/>
  <Param type="RichBool" description="Preserve Topology" value="true" name="PreserveTopology" tooltip="Avoid all the collapses that should cause a topology change in the mesh (like closing holes, squeezing handles, etc). If checked the genus of the mesh should stay unchanged."/>
  <Param type="RichBool" description="Optimal position of simplified vertices" value="false" name="OptimalPlacement" tooltip="Each collapsed vertex is placed in the position minimizing the quadric error.&#xa; It can fail (creating bad spikes) in case of very flat areas. &#xa;If disabled edges are collapsed onto one of the two original vertices and the final mesh is composed by a subset of the original vertices. "/>
  <Param type="RichBool" description="Planar Simplification" value="true" name="PlanarQuadric" tooltip="Add additional simplification constraints that improves the quality of the simplification of the planar portion of the mesh."/>
  <Param type="RichBool" description="Weighted Simplification" value="true" name="QualityWeight" tooltip="Use the Per-Vertex quality as a weighting factor for the simplification. The weight is used as a error amplification value, so a vertex with a high quality value will not be simplified and a portion of the mesh with low quality values will be aggressively simplified."/>

  <Param type="RichBool" description="Simplify only selected faces" value="false" name="Selected" tooltip="The simplification is applied only to the selected set of faces.&#xa; Take care of the target number of faces!"/>
